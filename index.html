                        I moved to Hawaii to learn how to surf ðŸŒŠ I didnâ€™t even know how to swim at first; now Iâ€™m comfortable in the water.

                        My <a href="writings/index.html">writing</a> garden ðŸª´ is where I collect notes and essays; my experiments live there too.

                        Iâ€™m a human making things for humans. I use AI as a tool to create more, but what I publish here is written by me.
