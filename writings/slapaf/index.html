        <span><big><b>slap af</b></big> - focus on features not ads </span>

            The phrase "slap af" is danish, in english it means to chill out or relax.
          </li>
          <li>
            The objective of this project is to allow ad revenue businesses to focus on features and give ad serving businesses a framework to define their rules so they can all relax a little. 
          </li>
          <li>
            We achieve this by creating two user object types, one for an ad serving user and another for an ad consuming user. The objects will define business rules such as price, inclusive/exclusive keywords and metadata. With predefined and structured objects we can create a recommendation engine that matches ads to ad consumers filtering on metadata within the object.
          </li>
          <li>
            As this grows ad consuming businesses might want to define their own models to match ads to their use case. One example is a social media platform that wants to get different ads based on a user model. Populating all users into the above schema creates overhead and is not scalable. The solution proposed it to add api support that lets businesses run their own models with our data. One potential solution using this method is clustering similar user profiles together then calling slap af with those clustered schema types to serve ads. This still is a lot more simple than trying to appease each ad company by their rules and generate high click rate on your own.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cost is the most important metadata item in this workflow, a ad serving organization needs to outline how much is paid per click, what is the cost ceiling for this campaign and the ad consuming organization can define pay out ranges for ads as a filter.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is still a work in progress and as I ideate more I will update this page!
